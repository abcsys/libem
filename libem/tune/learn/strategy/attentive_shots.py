Attentive Shots

1. Training pass: Identify and record errors from the first training pass,
   labeling these as "mistakes."
2. Chain of thought retraining: Apply a chain-of-thought prompting to retrain
   Libem on just the mistakes, marking successfully resolved instances as "corrected."
3. Few-shot prompting: Use the corrected examples to enhance the few-shot learning prompts,
   improving model training and generalization.
